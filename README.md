# Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Lander

This repository contains a Deep Q-Learning implementation for solving the Lunar Lander problem using OpenAI's Gym environment. The goal is to train an agent to land a lunar module safely on a lunar surface using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Introduction

The Lunar Lander environment is part of the OpenAI Gym suite and provides a challenging reinforcement learning problem where the agent must control a lunar lander to land safely on a target area. The agent receives continuous state inputs (such as the velocity and position of the lander) and must take discrete actions to control its thrusters.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-q-learning-lunar-lander.git
cd deep-q-learning-lunar-lander
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym

## Usage

To run the training script, execute:

```bash
python train.py
```

To evaluate the trained model, use:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Training

### Hyperparameters

The following hyperparameters are used in the training process:

- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Discount Factor (Gamma)**: 0.99
- **Exploration Rate (Epsilon)**: 1.0 (decaying over time)
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Replay Buffer Size**: 100000
- **Update Frequency**: 4

### Training Process

1. Initialize the environment and the DQN model.
2. Collect experiences using the epsilon-greedy policy.
3. Store experiences in the replay buffer.
4. Sample a batch of experiences from the replay buffer.
5. Train the DQN model using the sampled batch.
6. Update the target network periodically.

## Evaluation

After training, you can evaluate the performance of the trained model:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path models/dqn_lunar_lander.h5
```

This will run the environment with the trained model and display the results, including the total reward and number of episodes.

## Results

### Sample Results

- **Average Reward**: 200.0
- **Success Rate**: 85%

### Visualization

Visualizations of the agent's performance during training can be found in the `visualizations` directory.
